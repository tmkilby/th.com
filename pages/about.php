<div class="contentArea lightBG">
	<p>To help you learn a little more about me, I thought I would take the time
		to answer some questions you might have. 
		
		What do you do?
			for a living
			in free time
		
		What is this website all about?
			This website is a place for me to share some of my thoughts on what I learn, and to provide a central portal to the projects
			I'm working on, where I can also receive some feedback. I'm very proud of my work, and I'm thrilled you're visiting this site!
		
		What are you currently working on?
			at work
			in my free time
			
		What do you love about coding?
			used to be an editor, but now I code - why?
		
		What have you worked on in the past?
			previous technologies and my opinions on them
		
		
		I'm a software engineer. What does that mean? It means I design and develop efficient, bug-free applications
		that serve a purpose. I'm currently focused on building for the web using JavaScript as my primary
		tool. I'm seriously in love with JavaScript, and I'm heavily exploring Node.js at the moment, as I can't get over the fact
		that there is a library that so easily facilitates creating scalable apps using nothing but JavaScript (no more PHP for me!).
		In the past I've worked with Java, C#/.NET, a little bit of Ruby scripting, PHP, XSL, and a whole lotta SQL.</p>

		send you a copy of my resume. </p>
