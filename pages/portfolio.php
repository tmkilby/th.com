	<h2>About This Website</h2>
	<p>My rule when building, maintaining, and adding to this site is to do everything myself. This site is a chance for
		me to exercise my coding muscles, and I do that by adding as many features as I wish while minimizing the number
		of third-party helpers and plugins I use. This means I do a great deal of reinventing the wheel, but it's so far 
		been a great way to learn a lot in a very short amount of time, while being able to take a lot of pride in what I
		present on this site.</p>
	<p>To build this website, I started with HTML5 boilplate 
	(get name right and insert link, say why this is great). I develop all of my web apps in Aptana 
	Studio (give link, say why it is great). My server stack is a standard Apache, MySQL, PHP package. I am madly in love
	with jQuery, so almost all of my JavaScript uses it.</p>
